# Phase 2 Project: Movie Studio

## Overview
This project involves analyzing movie data in order to provide business recommendations to the stakeholders of my hypothetical movie studio "QMD+ Studios". The analysis utilized movie data from websites such as IMBd, Rotten Tomatoes, and Box Office Mojo which provide a multitude of movie information, such as box office performance and film details. Overall, the goal of this investigation was to find the highest performing movie genres in order to enhance the probability of the movie studio's financial success. In addition to this, two other recommendations were provided based on the top rated writers and directors and the correlation between producion budget and net profit. 



## Business Understanding
- **Key Business Questions:**

## Conclusion
- **Summary of Conclusions:**
    1. The top 5 most profitable domestic genres are:
        - Animation
        - Family
        - Music
        - Comedy
        - Adventure
        
        The top 5 most profitable worldwide gennre's are:
        - Adventure
        - Animation
        - Fantasy
        - Family
        - Science Fiction

        Depending on whether QMD+ Studios decides to release movies domestically or worldwide, these top 5 lists should be references for which genre to produce. 

    2. The top 10 highest rated directors:
        - Rodney Rothman
        - Bob Persichetti
        - Christopher Nolan
        - Anthony Russo
        - Joe Russo
        - Mel Gibson
        - Damian Szifron
        - Robert Eggers
        - Rajkumar Hirani
        - Stephen Chbosky

        The top 10 highest rated writers:
        - Quentin Tarantinoo
        - Jonathan Nolan
        - Philippe Pozzo di Borgo
        - Tony Kushner
        - Jason Katz
        - Brian Hayes Currie
        - Denis Villeneuve
        - Wajdi Mouawad
        - Jim Starlin
        - Jordan Belfort

    3. Production budgets should be optimized for maximum profit. For domestic movies, production budget should be minimized as increased production budget does not have much of an affect on domestic net profit. The available financing should be put towards other factors to maximize profit, such as increase marketing budget, casting high-demand actors, or expanded distribution channels. For worldwide movies, production budget has a much greater infuence on worldwide net profit. Because of this, production budget should be nearly maximized in order to maximize the net proft for worldwide film releases.
